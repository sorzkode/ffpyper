### Why VP9/AV1?

**VP9** delivers 20-50% smaller files than H.264 at equivalent quality. **AV1** is the next-generation codec offering slightly better compression than VP9. Both are open-source, royalty-free, and natively supported by YouTube, all modern browsers, and media servers like Plex and Jellyfin.  It's true that HEVC (h265) decoding is more common on current gen hardware, however, most (all?) consumer devices that have come out in the last few years can decode it.

Typical file sizes:
- **1080p TV episode**: ~200-400 MB
- **4K HDR Blu-ray film**: ~10-15 GB (higher for grain-heavy content)

## Prerequisites

### Required

**Rust 1.85+** (edition 2024):
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env
rustc --version  # Should show 1.85.0 or higher
```

**FFmpeg** with VP9/AV1 support (tested with v8.0):
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# macOS (or Linux with brew)
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Or install both automatically:**
```bash
make deps
```

### Optional (Hardware Encoding)

| Platform | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|
| **Intel QSV** | Linux, `/dev/dri` device mapped, Intel HD 5000+ or Arc GPU |
| **Intel/AMD VA-API** | Linux, `/dev/dri` device mapped, Mesa VAAPI drivers |
| **NVIDIA NVENC** | Linux, CUDA drivers, Ada Lovelace+ (RTX 4000 series or newer) |

Verify hardware support:
```bash
ffdash check-vaapi                    # Intel/AMD VA-API
ffmpeg -encoders | grep -E "vp9|av1"  # List available VP9/AV1 encoders
```

yay -S ffdash-bin

# macOS or Linux (Homebrew)
brew tap bcherb2/ffdash
brew install ffdash
```

### Build from source

git clone https://github.com/bcherb2/ffdash.git
cd ffdash
make release
sudo make install   # Installs to /usr/local/bin
```

### Verify installation

```bash
ffdash check-ffmpeg   # Verify FFmpeg is configured correctly
ffdash --help         # Show all commands
```

## Quick Start

### Basic usage

```bash
# Launch TUI and scan current directory
ffdash

# Launch TUI and scan a specific directory
ffdash /path/to/videos

# Preview FFmpeg commands without encoding
ffdash dry-run /path/to/video.mp4
```

### TUI navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `S` | Start encoding |
| `SPACE` | Toggle pending / skipped |
| `C` | Open config |
| `H` | Show help |
| `T` | Toggle stats view |
| `R` | Rescan directory |
| `Q` | Quit (confirms if encoding) |
| `X` | Clear state and exit |
| `↑↓` | Navigate queue |
| `Tab` | Cycle active jobs |
| `[`/`]` | Adjust workers |

### Configuration

Generate a config file to customize defaults:
```bash
ffdash init-config
# Creates ~/.config/ffdash/config.toml
```

Example configuration:
```toml
[startup]
autostart = false      # Wait for manual start
scan_on_launch = true  # Scan directory on launch

[defaults]
profile = "1080p Shrinker"      # Default encoding profile
max_workers = 1                 # Concurrent encode jobs
```

See [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md) for all options.

## Auto-VMAF Quality Calibration

Automatically calibrate encoder quality to achieve a target VMAF perceptual quality score.

**How it works:**
1. Before encoding, analyze 1-5 short sample windows (~10s each) from your video
2. Measure VMAF quality and adjust encoder settings iteratively
3. Encode the full file once quality meets your target

**Configuration** (in TUI Config screen):
- **Enable Auto-VMAF**: Checkbox to enable calibration
- **Target VMAF**: Desired quality score (default: 93.0, range: 0-100)
  - 80+ = broadcast quality
  - 90+ = high quality (recommended)
  - 95+ = near-transparent
- **Quality Step**: CRF/quality adjustment per iteration (default: 2)
- **Max Attempts**: Maximum calibration iterations (default: 3)

**Supported modes:**
- ✅ Software: CQ (constant quality), CQCap (CQ + max bitrate)
- ✅ Hardware: CQP mode only
- ❌ VBR/CBR modes not supported

**Performance:** Adds ~10% overhead via sparse sampling (60s total analysis budget, evaluates 1 frame/sec).

**Status display:** Shows "Calibrating" during analysis, displays achieved VMAF in results column.

Please be familiar with VMAF and how it works.  There can be some differences between scores of older or highly compressed / low-res footage - I assume this is because of the objectively low quality being used as a reference.

See [docs/AUTO_VMAF.md](docs/AUTO_VMAF.md) for detailed algorithm and advanced settings.

## Command Reference

## FAQ

**I changed settings but they didn't apply to my encode?**

If a queue is already built, you need to rescan (`R`) to apply new settings. This is similar to how Handbrake's queue works.

**How do I verify hardware encoding is active?**
- Help screen shows what hardware acceleration is available
- Logs are written to directory where `ffdash` is launched 
- Use tools like `nvidia-smi` or `intel_gpu_top` to verify utilization
- It should be *very* obvious - CPU encoding will take HOURS for most films


**What quality settings should I use?**

I almost always use AV1 with QSV encoder on slowest (1) with a quality of between 80 and 140, depending on the resolution, quality, etc.

**Can I pause and resume encoding?**

Yes. Press `Q` to quit - if encodes are running, you'll be asked to confirm. Progress is saved to `.enc_state` in each directory. Run `ffdash` again to resume where you left off.

**Why aren't my video files showing up?**

Supported formats: `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.webm`, `.flv`, `.m4v`

Press `R` to rescan the directory after adding files.

**Why am I having issues encoding this Blu-ray?**

- Use mkv filetypes for Blu-rays
- In my experience most issues are either audio related, or color depth.  Start in passthru and change settings from there.
- Logs will pass through ffmpeg errors

**How much faster is hardware encoding?**

Way faster than software encoding. Quality may be slightly lower at equivalent bitrates, so consider increasing bitrate by ~20% when using hardware encoding.
In rare cases, you may want to use software encoding for AV1.  You may want to do this for maximum compression, or to use the software-only film-grain options.

**Getting errors on 5+ channel audio?**

Likely need to increase the audio bitrate, or force downmixing into stereo.  Passthru may also be your best option if using something like TrueHD audio.

**The TUI looks broken over SSH**

Ensure your terminal supports 256 colors and your `TERM` variable is set correctly:
```bash
export TERM=xterm-256color
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "No hardware devices detected" | Verify `/dev/dri` exists (VA-API) or `--gpus all` is set (NVENC) |
| Encoding fails immediately | Run `ffdash dry-run` and test the command manually with `ffmpeg` |
| Wrong encoder selected | Check hardware toggle in Config screen (`C`) |
| Slow performance | Press `]` to add workers, or enable hardware encoding |
